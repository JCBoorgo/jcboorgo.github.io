  <div class="spellType">Special thanks</div>
  <br>
  <div>
    First of all, the importantest of them all, I need to thank Hevipelle. He had the idea for the game, we worked on it for a while, <br>
    and when he abandoned it he let me copy it to my own GitHub (that means here) and he just let me free of doing whatever I want with it. <br>
    Seriously, this game would not exist if he was not there. Thanks a lot Hevi. Also, in case you still don't know his main game yet, <br>
    go play <a href="http://ivark.github.io" target="_newtab">Antimatter Dimensions</a>. I look at the code often when I'm not sure of what I'm doing, plus the game is just really fantastic. <br> <br>
    I also have to thank db72432 on GitHub, who opened an issue on the original SpellMaster repo, saying that "we'd need a license (fork friendly if possible) to add content to it". <br>
    That was a nice motivation kick to actually not be lazy and work on it, because I didn't want another person to do this before me. <br>
    So yeah, thanks for your interest, you can still do a fork if you want to, but I can now say that I've done it first. HA. <br> <br>
    Last thanks for now, thank you, whoever it was, to the person who posted the game while we were working on it on the Incremental Games subreddit. <br>
    People received it reeeeeeeally well, and it also helped me realise that this has potential. <br> <br>
    Small sidenote: as of right now I haven't added anything new to the game (just did a couple "indev proofings" to make sure people don't break too many things while I work on it), <br>
    and I can't transfer your saves from Hevi's GitHub to mine. Plus we don't have exporting/importing. Anyway, game's not long as of right now, so it shouldn't be bad, <br>
    but hopefully I'll stay not-lazy and content will come. Also, balance right now is kinda unimportant to me (except for critical stuff), I just need to get content out. <br>
    Anyway, enjoy the ride, don't expect the game to stay as it is right now, changes are coming, stuff and things, yadda yadda, you can stop reading, <br>
    why are you still reading, no, seriously, don't, like, what?

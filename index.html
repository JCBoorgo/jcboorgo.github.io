  <div id="presentation" style="width: 65%; float:left">Here you are, you have landed on my site. Are you here on accident?
    <br>Perhaps you're someone looking to play a game... or maybe you're an employer looking to see what I've done?
    <br>Well it, doesn't matter, I'm glad to have you here! Let me introduce myself.
    <br>I'm Jean-Christophe Bourgault, or JCBoorgo if you prefer, I'm currently 20, living in Qu√©bec.
    <br>I'm studying in software engineering currently, I'd like to make games for a living, or anything useful for the world.

  <div id="game-text">Nothing to see here for now, but something <i>might</i> be coming soon...
    <br>Also I think the CSS is broken, it doesn't want to update, oh well... /shrug</div>

  <div id="presentation" style="width: 65%; float:left">Here you are, you have landed on my site. Are you here on accident?
    <br>Perhaps you're someone looking to play a game... or maybe you're an employer looking to see what I've done?
    <br>Well, it doesn't matter, I'm glad to have you here! Let me introduce myself.
    <br>I'm Jean-Christophe Bourgault, or JCBoorgo if you prefer, I'm currently 20, living in Qu√©bec.
    <br>I'm studying in software engineering currently, I'd like to make games for a living, or anything useful for the world.
    <br>I still only have one (very unfinished) (actually now two!) game on here, but it should grow, eventually.
    <br>Enjoy your stay! Or don't. As you wish, honestly. I won't mind too much.

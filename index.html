    <br>Perhaps you're someone looking to play a game... or maybe you're an employer looking to see what I've done?
    <br>Well, it, doesn't matter, I'm glad to have you here! Let me introduce myself.

    <br>I'm studying in software engineering currently, I'd like to make games for a living, or anything useful for the world.</div>
